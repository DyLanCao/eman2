"""
The simple logger does the same as the default logger above. It is simpler
though, easier to use, and more flexible. It is not clear whether replacing the
original logger is safe to do though so, for now, we keep both.
"""
class SimpleLogger( object ):
	"""
	Simple class to log lines during execution. Makes use of sxprint to add
	timestamps and caller information to each line.

	Constructor args:

		filename (string): If provided the log is also printed to a file of the
			given name. Otherwise the log is only printed to the screen.
			[Default: ""]
	
		print_log (bool): Set to False to not print the log lines to the screen.
			NOTE: This only makes sense when a file name is given, otherwise the
			log is not printed at all.
